# Multiplayer-Connect-4-X
## Summary
A custimizable Connect 4 game. Upon entering the game, you will be prompted with some customizable options. You will be able to select and customize the number of players from two to four, change the playing grid size, and also the number in a series required to win.

## Update:
I was not able to (within the given time) allow the user to customize the amount of players. I have two working versions however MultiplayerConnectX-2.py is the two player version, and MultiplayerConnectX-3.py is the three player version. Both versions allow customization of the grid size, and number in a series required to win.
